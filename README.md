#awb

awb is a fast, lightweight, minimalistic browser with vim like controls written in c.

##Warning

This is a very quick and dirty Prototype just to test the capabilities of webkit and how to realize a simple browser. DO NOT use this as your codebase. I will completly rewrite this code whenever I find the time to continue with it.
